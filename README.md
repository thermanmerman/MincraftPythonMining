# MincraftPythonMining

This is a bot I made after my brother started a minecraft server and I decided that I wanted to become the richest
player there without too much effort. I made this bot to collect resources for me by using image recognition
on the screen to detect when valuable resources were in view and to notify me when that happens. While it should
technically work, it was written in python, so even with the 20-something training pictures I used, it took about
10 seconds to search through all the pictures before moving on to the next step. This was one of my first projects
and I barely knew how to code at the time, so don't judge me too harshly please.
