# MincraftPythonMining

One of my first programming projects was to make a bot that collected resources on my older brother Ben’s Minecraft server. My goal was to become the richest player, which I knew would drive Ben crazy. I collected resources by using image recognition to detect when valuable resources were in view and to notify me when that happens. Because this program was written in Python, even with the 20-something training pictures I used, it took about 10 seconds to search through all of them before moving to the next step. This was one of my first projects and I barely knew how to code at the time, but it was still fun because my brother couldn’t figure out how I was able to so quickly and successfully collect resources. (For the record, I love my brother, but I have to admit that project was irresistibly entertaining and rewarding, and is one of the projects that spurred my passion for computer programming.)
